# Start Here - Campaign Management CMS Project

## Welcome to the Campaign Management CMS Project! üöÄ

You are joining a project that is **already in progress**. Before you begin any development work, it's crucial that you understand the project context, requirements, current progress, and development standards.

## üìö Required Reading (MUST READ ALL)

Please read the following documents **in this exact order** to get up to speed:

### 1. **PRD_Campaign_Management_CMS.md**
- Read this FIRST to understand what we're building
- Contains all product requirements and business logic
- Defines core entities, user interface requirements, and workflow specifications

### 2. **Project_Phases.md** 
- Shows the development roadmap and current progress
- Indicates which phases are complete and what's next
- Contains specific deliverables and success criteria for each phase
- Includes QA requirements that must be met before phase approval

### 3. **Technical_Specifications.md**
- Technical architecture and technology stack decisions
- Database schema and API endpoint definitions
- Development workflow and port configurations

### 4. **BestPractices.md**
- **CRITICAL**: Code quality standards and testing requirements
- DRY principles, unit testing strategy, and debugging practices
- Security guidelines and performance considerations
- QA checklist that must be followed for all development

### 5. **WorkWithHuman.md**
- Development process and human collaboration guidelines
- How to work in phases and get approval before proceeding
- Communication best practices and testing instructions

## üéØ What to Do After Reading

Once you have thoroughly read **ALL FIVE** documents:

1. **Let the human know** that you have completed reading all the required documentation
2. **Summarize your understanding** of:
   - What the project is building
   - Which phase we're currently on
   - What development standards must be followed
   - What the next steps should be

3. **Ask for further instructions** on what specific work should be done next

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **DO NOT start coding** until you've read all documentation and gotten approval from the human
- **DO NOT skip the Best Practices document** - it contains mandatory requirements for code quality, testing, and development standards
- **Follow the phased approach** - never work on multiple phases simultaneously
- **Always get human approval** before moving between phases
