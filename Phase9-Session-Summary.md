# Phase 9 – Session Summary (2025-08-11)

## Highlights
- Offer editor polish
	- Added CTA field under Description.
	- Character limits with counters: Header 30, Description 75, CTA 30.
	- Removed Offer Image URL input from UI (placeholders remain for future uploaders).
	- Added SKU and Form Label fields.
	- Computed Redeem URL from SKU + Form Label in Draft; guidance when missing inputs.
	- Read-only view shows computed URL and adds Copy URL icon with toast.
- Header actions ordering
	- Icon-only transparent actions (Duplicate, AI Duplicate, Delete) now precede secondary and primary across states.
- Partner + Dashboard
	- Partner tagging supported end-to-end; Dashboard shows Partner column with filter and persisted column visibility.

## Backend/Frontend changes
- Backend
	- Updated Ajv schema for OFFER to include optional sku and formLabel.
	- Templates extended to seed sku and formLabel; meaningful-config helper updated.
- Frontend
	- `CampaignEditor.tsx` updated for new fields, counters, computed URL, and copy-to-clipboard.
	- Helpers mirror backend meaningful-config logic.

## Verification
- Restarted backend (port 3001) and frontend (port 3000).
- Health checks:
	- GET /api/health → OK
	- GET /api/db-health → OK
- Manual smoke of editor and read-only views for Offer.

## Notes / Next
- Image upload integration remains a placeholder.
- Consider adding Copy URL in Draft mode as well for parity.
