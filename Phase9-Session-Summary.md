# Phase 9 â€“ Multi-market Variants + AI Suggestions (Aug 10, 2025)

What changed today:
- Frontend: Campaign Editor now supports multiple market variants per campaign (add/duplicate/delete, market dropdown with uniqueness guard). Read-only view lists variants by market. Polished widths and collapsed dropdown label.
- Backend: Ajv validation extended to `config.variants[]` with allowed markets and uniqueness. `PUT /api/campaigns/:id/config` derives `campaign.markets` from variants; legacy single-config still supported.
- AI assist: Added `POST /api/ai/suggest` endpoint and wired frontend `aiService.suggestVariant(...)` + modal flow to insert suggested variant content for a selected market.
- Publish/Schedule: Save config and channel settings before transitions; compute end defaults when applicable; then transition and reload.
- Runbook: Clarified running from `campaign-cms/` root and added tips for resolving port conflicts and dashboard fetch errors.

Quick verify:
- Backend health: http://localhost:3001/api/health
- Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/ (Retry if backend just started)
- AI Suggest: POST http://localhost:3001/api/ai/suggest

Next:
- Harden server-side workflow gating for variants presence/uniqueness when publishing/scheduling.
- Channel configuration UI + reporting (Phase 7).
