# Project Phases for Campaign Management CMS

## Overview
This document outlines the phased approach for developing the Campaign Management CMS. Each phase is designed to be manageable, testable, and approvable before moving to the next phase.

## ✅ Phase 1: Project Scaffolding and Environment Setup - COMPLETE
**Goal**: Set up the development environment and basic project structure
**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Initialize Node.js project with package.json
- ✅ Create project directory structure
- ✅ Set up basic Express.js server
- ✅ Implement environment configuration (dotenv)
- ✅ Create a simple "Hello World" endpoint
- ✅ Set up basic HTML frontend
- ✅ Configure development scripts (start, dev, etc.)
- ✅ Initialize Git repository and commit initial setup

**Success Criteria**: ✅ Can run both backend and frontend locally and see a "Hello World" message
**Completion Date**: August 6, 2025

## ✅ Phase 2: Database Design and Implementation - COMPLETE
**Goal**: Implement the data layer with SQLite
**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Set up SQLite database connection using Sequelize ORM
- ✅ Create database schema (campaigns table with proper validation)
- ✅ Implement Campaign model with JSON field support
- ✅ Create comprehensive CRUD operations for campaigns API
- ✅ Add seed data with realistic campaign examples
- ✅ Implement port management strategy (API: 3001, Frontend: 3000)
- ✅ Add database management tools (reset script)
- ✅ Clarify timing architecture (campaign-level dates, channel timing deferred)

**Success Criteria**: ✅ Can perform create, read, update, and delete operations on campaigns via API calls with proper validation and realistic test data
**Completion Date**: August 6, 2025

**Key Architectural Decisions**:
- Campaign timing: startDate/endDate at campaign level, channel-specific timing in future phase
- Port separation: Backend API (3001) and Frontend (3000) for development workflow
- Database tooling: Reset and management scripts for development efficiency

## Phase 3: Backend API Development
**Goal**: Complete all required API endpoints
**Deliverables**:
- Implement all campaign API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Add campaign state management logic
- Implement market targeting functionality
- Add channel management
- Create reporting endpoints
- Add validation and error handling

**Success Criteria**: All API endpoints defined in technical specs are working and properly validated

## Phase 4: Frontend Dashboard Implementation
**Goal**: Create the main dashboard UI
**Deliverables**:
- Design and implement campaign table view
- Add sorting by date functionality
- Implement state display for each campaign
- Create edit pencil icon with click handler
- Add responsive design for different screen sizes

**Success Criteria**: Dashboard displays campaign data in a table with proper sorting and edit functionality

## Phase 5: Frontend Campaign Detail View
**Goal**: Create the campaign creation and editing interface
**Deliverables**:
- Design campaign creation/editing form
- Implement form validation
- Add state management controls
- Implement market selection (single, multiple, all)
- Add channel selection
- Create tab interface for editing

**Success Criteria**: Can create and edit campaigns with all required fields through the UI

## Phase 6: Workflow and State Management
**Goal**: Implement complete campaign workflow functionality
**Deliverables**:
- Add campaign state transition logic
- Implement publish scheduling functionality
- Create date selection components
- Add confirmation dialogs for deletions
- Implement unschedule and stop campaign features

**Success Criteria**: All campaign state transitions work correctly with proper validation

## Phase 7: Channel Configuration and Reporting
**Goal**: Implement channel-specific configurations and reporting
**Deliverables**:
- Create channel configuration interfaces
- Implement reporting dashboard
- Add channel-specific metrics display
- Create report generation functionality

**Success Criteria**: Each channel has configurable options and reports can be viewed per campaign/channel

## Phase 8: Testing and Optimization
**Goal**: Ensure application quality and performance
**Deliverables**:
- Add unit tests for backend APIs
- Implement end-to-end tests for frontend
- Optimize database queries
- Add loading states and error handling
- Performance testing and optimization

**Success Criteria**: Application passes all tests and performs well under expected load

## Phase 9: Deployment and Documentation
**Goal**: Prepare for deployment and create documentation
**Deliverables**:
- Create deployment configuration for Codespaces
- Write user documentation
- Create developer documentation
- Implement production build processes
- Add example configurations

**Success Criteria**: Application can be deployed to Codespaces and is properly documented
